Description: A function that determines if a date is a "real date" in the common era, 
   accounting for leap years (runs in Standard ML)

(* Note that a “date” is an SML value of type int*int*int, where the first part (#1 date) is the year, the second part (#2 date) is the month, and the third part (#3 date) is the day. *)

    if null ints then false
    else 
        if num = hd ints then true
        else in_list(tl ints, num)
